# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measurements using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project contains various diagnostic measurements such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc., along with an indicator for diabetes onset.

## Overview

The project includes the following main sections:

1. **Explore Data**: In this section, we explore the dataset to understand its structure, identify any missing values, visualize correlations between features, and analyze distributions and relationships between variables.

2. **Modeling**: This section involves building machine learning models to predict diabetes onset. Various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting are employed and evaluated based on accuracy, recall, and F1-score.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
